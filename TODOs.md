## Docker

- Create a Makefile
- Handle different chip architectures
- Handle volume mounting correctly

## File Structure

- Use global settings or config

## Pipeline

- Build so that there is a more standard "pipeline" structure with error handling
- Figure out when we need to copy the dataframe vs when we just need to return slices
